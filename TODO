TODO file for Business-OnlinePayment-CashCow

$Id: TODO,v 1.3 2005-08-09 09:35:44 jonasbn Exp $

* Implement handling of e-dankort card type

* Implement handling of ecredit transactions (default is PBS)

* Implement handling of subscribtions

* Investigate return values and use of: authorization() and result_code()

* Investigate test flags (TestFlg)

* Make it possible to control what fields are mandatory and optional. This
could be done via the optional processor info parameter to the constructor.

* The tests reveal a warning of sorts from Net::SSLeay - it would be nice
to have this warning eliminated.

* Some warnings are issued due to redefinition of autoloaded subs built
by the SUPER class, this would be nice to get out of the way aswell
