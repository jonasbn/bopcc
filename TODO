TODO file for Business-OnlinePayment-CashCow

$Id: TODO,v 1.5 2006-09-06 13:08:29 jonasbn Exp $

* Look into problems with separation between ok and nok, see Changes entry
  for 0.06

* We might need to require Module::Build 0.2611 (I have experienced problems
  with 0.2609) on FreeBSD the notes do not seem to be stored in _build/notes

* Implement handling of e-dankort card type

* Implement handling of ecredit transactions (default is PBS)

* Implement handling of subscribtions

* Investigate return values and use of: authorization() and result_code()

* Investigate test flags (TestFlg)

* Make it possible to control what fields are mandatory and optional. This
could be done via the optional processor info parameter to the constructor.

* The tests reveal a warning of sorts from Net::SSLeay - it would be nice
to have this warning eliminated.

* Some warnings are issued due to redefinition of autoloaded subs built
by the SUPER class, this would be nice to get out of the way aswell
