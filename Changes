0.09 2007-06-18

- Bug fix release, update recommended

- Fixed bug in handling of XML response, apparently the '&' in a customername
  was causing parsing trouble, we now URI escape this single character. More
  work in this is needed, but this fixes an eminent problem in a production
  environment


0.08 2007-03-17

- Maintenance release, update not necessary

- Fixed bad Perl::Critic test (t/critic.t), should use require not use. So we
  can catch the exception of Test::Perl::Critic not being installed


0.07 2007-03-15

- Maintenance release, update not necessary

- Fixed a few obvious Perl::Critic violations and set severity in Perl::Critic
  test to 5, gentle

- Added Perl::Critic test t/critic.t

- Added t/perlcriticrc (severity 1, brutal)

- Added kwalitee test, t/kwalitee.t

- Added POD test, t/pod.t

- Added POD coverage test, t/pod-coverage.t

- Updated MANIFEST


0.06 2006-09-06

- Bug fix release, update recommended

- Fixed problem with handling of CashCow response, it's format for some reason
  seem to have changed, this highlights one of the more serious problems of 
  the interaction with CashCow and that is should be the other way around,
  we should always decline unless we get an ok from CashCow.
    
  I will raise the issue with CashCow.


0.05 2006-09-04

- Maintenance release, update recommended

- Added some better exception handling of the response from the CashCow gateway

- Removed t/pod.t, obsoleted by Module::Build

- Removed t/pod-coverage.t, obsoleted by Module::Build


0.04 2005-12-09

- Added Module::Build generation of Makefile.PL in Build.PL

- Deleted old Makefile.PL

- Possible fix to broken test:
	http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.cpan.testers/261408
	
  I have not been able to recreate the scenario where the tests breaks, but I 
  pilfered a bit in the logic so we can handle one more exception


0.03 2005-10-17

- Maintenance release, update not necessary

- Added version number to prerequisite of Business::OnlinePayment after dealing 
  with weird problems (segmentation fault) - the host with the problew
  was running Business::OnlinePayment 0.00???

  This have just been a bad version-number parsing, there was a valid version 
  of Business::OnlinePayment on the platform in question.
  

0.02 2005-10-12

- Maintenance release, update recommended

- Test coverage 98.6% (as close as we get)

- Cleaned out use of Carp

- Small changes to return values (I hate when modules just die/croak)

- Removed: map_fields method

- Added more unit-tests (_process_response.t)

- Apparently XML::Simple just dies upon exception, so an eval has been added
  to handle these exceptions - triggered by some weird responses from the 
  CashCow gateway


0.01 2005-08-09

- Initial release

- Added MANIFEST

- Updated POD, README and TODO

- Cleaned the code some more

- All unit-tests pass and the Net::SSLeay warning seems to have gone away
  moved some caveat bullets to the TODO list instead

- Cleared out unecessary referer handling

- Fixed submit test, so we skip if no shopid is provided

- Added shopid flag to Build.PL
